# Rotating-Fan--Computer-Graphics-Simulation-of-a-Rotating-Fan
The "Rotating Fan" project in C uses computer graphics to simulate the rotation of a fan. By utilizing functions from graphics libraries like &lt;graphics.h>, it creates a visual representation of a fan with blades that rotate around a central axis, demonstrating basic animation and graphics manipulation techniques in C.
